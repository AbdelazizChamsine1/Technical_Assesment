# Test Prompts for Media Planning Agent

## 1. Data Analysis Questions (Should NOT trigger media plan workflow)

### Basic Performance Queries
```
"What's the cost per lead for each channel?"
```
Expected: Agent uses SummarizeChannelPerformance and shows cost per lead analysis with reasoning

```
"Show me the performance summary of all channels"
```
Expected: Agent uses SummarizeChannelPerformance and explains efficiency differences

```
"How much did we spend on Meta last month?"
```
Expected: Agent uses SummarizeChannelPerformance and shows Meta spend data

### Comparison Queries
```
"Compare Meta vs Snapchat efficiency"
```
Expected: Agent uses data tools and provides detailed comparison with insights

```
"Which channel has better click rates?"
```
Expected: Agent analyzes click data and explains the differences

### Top Performers
```
"What are the top channels for leads?"
```
Expected: Agent uses TopChannelsByKPI with "leads" as input

```
"Show me the best performing channels for clicks"
```
Expected: Agent uses TopChannelsByKPI with "clicks" as input

### Filtered Data
```
"Show me data for conversion campaigns only"
```
Expected: Agent uses FilterByObjective with "conversion" as input

```
"What's the performance of traffic campaigns?"
```
Expected: Agent uses FilterByObjective with "traffic" as input

## 2. Media Plan Creation (Should trigger full workflow)

### Complete Information in One Message
```
"I have a budget of 10000 for a conversion campaign and I prefer Meta"
```
Expected: Agent processes all inputs and automatically generates media plan

```
"Create a media plan: budget: 15000, objective: traffic, channel: snapchat"
```
Expected: Agent recognizes all inputs and immediately creates plan with Snapchat preference

```
"Help me plan a campaign. My budget is 20000, objective is conversion, no channel preference"
```
Expected: Agent processes inputs and creates efficiency-based allocation

### Partial Information (Should collect missing pieces)
```
"I need a media plan for my campaign"
```
Expected: Agent asks for all 3 missing inputs

```
"Create a conversion campaign with 12000 budget"
```
Expected: Agent processes these 2 inputs, asks only for channel preference

```
"I want to run a campaign on Meta"
```
Expected: Agent stores Meta preference, asks for objective and budget

### Natural Language Variations
```
"I've got 25k to spend on getting more leads, and I really like Meta"
```
Expected: Agent interprets as budget: 25000, objective: conversion, channel: meta

```
"Help me split 8000 dollars between channels for a traffic campaign"
```
Expected: Agent interprets correctly and asks for channel preference

## 3. Campaign Updates (Should modify and regenerate)

### Budget Changes
```
"Change my budget to 30000"
```
Expected: Agent updates budget and asks if user wants new plan

```
"Actually, let's increase the budget to 50000"
```
Expected: Agent updates and offers to regenerate plan

### Objective Changes
```
"Switch my objective to traffic instead"
```
Expected: Agent updates objective and offers new plan

```
"Update objective: conversion"
```
Expected: Agent processes update

### Channel Preference Changes
```
"Let's focus more on Snapchat"
```
Expected: Agent updates preference to Snapchat and offers to recalculate

```
"Remove my channel preference"
```
Expected: Agent sets preference to none and offers efficiency-based plan

### Multiple Updates
```
"budget: 35000, objective: traffic, channel: meta"
```
Expected: Agent updates all values and regenerates plan

## 4. Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Invalid Inputs
```
"Create a plan for awareness campaigns"
```
Expected: Agent explains only conversion/traffic are valid objectives

```
"My budget is 500"
```
Expected: Agent accepts but might warn about small budget

```
"I prefer Google Ads"
```
Expected: Agent explains only Meta/Snapchat are available

### Ambiguous Requests
```
"What should I do with my campaign?"
```
Expected: Agent asks for clarification

```
"Help me optimize"
```
Expected: Agent asks what user wants to optimize

### Mixed Requests
```
"What's the cost per lead for Meta and also create a plan with 10000 budget"
```
Expected: Agent should handle data question first, then media plan

## 5. Reasoning and Iteration Tests

### Request for Explanation
```
"Why did you allocate more to Meta?"
```
Expected: Agent explains efficiency data and reasoning

```
"Show me the data behind this recommendation"
```
Expected: Agent provides performance metrics supporting allocation

### Iterative Refinement
```
"Can we allocate even more to Meta?"
```
Expected: Agent shows impact of increasing Meta allocation to 85%

```
"What if we split 50/50?"
```
Expected: Agent explains trade-offs of equal split vs efficiency-based

### What-If Scenarios
```
"What would happen if I doubled my budget?"
```
Expected: Agent shows how allocation scales

```
"How would this change for a traffic objective instead?"
```
Expected: Agent compares conversion vs traffic allocations

## 6. Full Conversation Flows

### Flow 1: Discovery to Plan
```
User: "How are my channels performing?"
User: "Interesting, I want to create a campaign"
User: "Budget is 15000, objective is conversion, prefer Meta"
```
Expected: Data analysis → Plan creation workflow

### Flow 2: Plan then Refine
```
User: "budget: 20000, objective: traffic, channel: none"
User: "Actually, let's focus on Meta"
User: "What if we increased to 25000?"
```
Expected: Initial plan → Update preference → Update budget

### Flow 3: Analysis-Driven Planning
```
User: "Which channel is best for conversions?"
User: "OK create a plan focusing on that channel with 18000 budget"
```
Expected: Analysis informs plan creation

## 7. Stress Tests

### Missing Data Handling
```
"Show me cost per lead for TikTok"
```
Expected: Agent explains only Meta/Snapchat data available

### Complex Natural Language
```
"I'm thinking about running a campaign next month with maybe around fifteen thousand dollars or so, probably for conversions but I'm not totally sure, and I've had good experience with Meta in the past"
```
Expected: Agent extracts budget: 15000, objective: conversion, channel: meta

### Multiple Intents
```
"Show me everything about my channels and then let's make a plan"
```
Expected: Agent handles sequentially - data first, then plan workflow
